							<h1>Google Design Exercise</h1>
							Hello everyone! I would like to present to you my solution to a design exercise given to me by Google. I picked the exercise that I thought would allow me to best demonstrate my skills and would have the most pleasure in completing.  Without further ado, let us begin!</p>

							<h2>Design Exercise</h2>
							<blockquote>Your school wants to improve the upkeep of campus facilities by creating a new system for reporting any facilities that may need maintenance or repair. Design an experience that allows students to report building or equipment issues on campus. Consider the process of those filing the report and of those receiving and taking action on the issues.</blockquote>

							<h2>The start of my journey</h2>
							<p>When first approaching this exercise, I thought it would be a good idea to organize my thoughts and ideas while tackling this problem. I researched the current maintenance and repair system for universities and realized that the tactics used eons ago are still used now. That most popular tactic being you, the student, calling in and reporting the issue to administrative staff. Afterward, you simply wait with no feedback whatsoever.  FYI, the wait is VERY long.</p>

							<h2>So, what is the problem?</h2>

							<p>I realized the only way for you to measure the success of your report was to simply wait and see if what you wanted fixed or maintained hopefully happened. Clearly, this was not an effective way to update users who reported tickets. From that pain point, I questioned why that was the case. This helped me discover additional pain points that I have outlined below. Moreover, I have also started adding in the type of UI I want to incorporate and what google products to integrate.</p>

							<h2>How do I fix this?</h2>
							<p>From my brainstorm of thoughts and ideas, I summarized the pain points I wanted to focus on into three distinct goals that I would like to achieve.

							The goals being:
							<ul>
								<li>Alleviate inefficient and time-consuming ticket queues</li>
								<li>Minimize repetitive tickets to reduce queue overload</li>
								<li>Continuously update users and admins on repairs and maintenances while keeping them clear and concise</li>
							</ul>

							Now that it is out of the way, it’s time to design the greatest app ever (in my eyes).

							<h2>Who needs Sketch?</h2>
							<p>With the research I put in and the requirements I set out for myself, I was ready to begin. I made sure to stick closely to the three goals I set out for myself to accomplish. Initially, I wanted to design my low fidelity design using Sketch, however, I own a PC, so it was unavailable <i>(sad violin music)</i>. Being the undeterred person as I am, my next best solution was Adobe Illustrator which was painstakingly long but gave me the results I was looking for.  </p>

						<div class="spotlight style1">
							<div class="content">
							<p>For navigation, I opted for 3 selective views:
							<ol>
								<li>Pinpoint map</li>
								<li>Ticket submission - students & ticket reviews - admins</li>
								<li>Simple user settings</li>
							</ol>
							Besides the ticket submission tab, I kept the other tabs as close as possible to each other because I felt that both parties should have the same easy experience. Also, implementation can be quite painful when it feels like there are two apps in one. 
							<br></br>
							For filing and receiving the report, I tried to make the fill out form straightforward and clear as possible to cover all various incidents of repair and maintenance. I also gave the option for users to attach images because in my experience, visuals are always helpful in understanding a problem.

							Now we move onto the meat and potatoes of user flow:

								The login screen is very simple and has a picture of our logo (mend) on it. I went for a basic design because I don’t want to scare users into believing that the app is difficult to use. 
								<br></br>
								Moving on, I created an easy signup page that can help differentiate between the students and administrators by asking who they are and to input their ID. I asked for their ID in order to deter students from falsifying their identities and making fake tickets since they can be immediately identified by administration.
								<br></br>
								Firebase will verify and approve of all credentials during signup while the user is being shown a nice loading animation before being taken to the map interface. If there is something invalid, they will be redirected back to the signup page.
